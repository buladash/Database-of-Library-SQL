Semester work on the topic "Library Database System" focuses on the design and implementation of a database that allows for effective information management in the library. The system includes key tables such as authors, readers, books, libraries, librarians, departments, announcements, reviews, book status and publishing house. Each table is designed to store the necessary data, and the relationships between these tables are defined through foreign keys, which ensures consistency and data linkage. Dal.

The database system was created to enable fast and efficient information retrieval and data organization. The goal was to facilitate the work of librarians in managing collections and at the same time improve access to this information for readers. Thanks to a well-designed table linkage, it is possible to easily perform queries that will allow the library to be effectively managed, track loans, manage reviews and announcements, and also monitor the status of books.

This project contributes to the optimization of the daily operation of the library, improves organization and ensures effective work with data. This system will serve as an excellent basis for further development and adaptation of the library system to the needs of users. In the future, the system can be supplemented with new functions, such as electronic book reservations, which would further facilitate the work of the library and readers' access to the necessary information. The implementation of such a system can be a significant step towards modernizing the library environment and improving the overall quality of library services.
